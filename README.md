## Getting started

To preview the projects in this repository you can:

Option A — open files directly
- Open `index.html` (or other HTML files) in your browser.

Option B — run a simple local server (recommended)
- Using Node (http-server):
  ```bash
  npx http-server -c-1
  ```
- Using Python 3:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and navigate to the relevant demo page.

## Project structure (typical)

While file layout may vary by task, expect something like:

- index.html — main entry or collection of links to tasks
- /js — JavaScript source files for tasks
- /css — styles used across tasks
- /assets — images or other static assets
- /tasks or /examples — individual exercises or mini-projects

If your repo differs, adjust these paths as needed.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MayankSahay4974/WebDevTask1.git
   cd WebDevTask1
   ```
2. Start a local server (see options above).
3. Open the appropriate HTML file in your browser.

No build step is required for plain HTML/CSS/JS tasks unless a specific task includes a build system. Check each task's folder for extra instructions or package.json.

## Common tasks included

Examples you may find or add:
- DOM manipulation exercises
- Form validation examples
- Small interactive apps (todo lists, calculators)
- Responsive layout exercises
- Fetch/Ajax examples (if any sample APIs used)

If you'd like, I can scan the repository and list actual files and tasks found.

## Contributing

- Add new tasks in their own folders with clear README or comments.
- Keep each task small and focused; include a brief description and how to run it.
- Use descriptive filenames and consistent structure (index.html, js/, css/).
- Open an issue or pull request with changes.
